During this time, she was acting as an online 'water army' for Xiao Zhan. In March 2020, the AO3 website was reported and blocked. In May, Xiao Zhan faced widespread boycott from netizens, and investors began to reconsider their involvement. In June, a digital album was released, and the daughter stole money from home to buy it. As the pandemic eased, she continued to participate in fan activities but gradually began to see its true nature. In February 2021, Xiao Zhan sued his 'haters'. In August, he won the case, and fans were fined 30,000 yuan. The parent in the story then grounded their daughter completely.",
